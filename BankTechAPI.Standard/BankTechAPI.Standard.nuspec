Access our feature-rich console or build your own solution with our API-based architecture.

API Calls regarding **DebiCheck, Communication (WhatsApp and SMS), Transactions, Verification and Mandates.**

#### Mandates 
Consumers authenticate the payment series (or "mandate") either in real-time on their mobile or on one of their banks' channels (USSD, banking app, ATM, etc.).
A mandate is an authorization that a debtor gives to a creditor that enables the creditor to initiate a request for payment for a debt. The company that extends credit to a customer is the creditor. The customer is the debtor.

#### Transactions 
Make payments from any South African bank
Get paid by any combination of the following methods
- Once-off debit orders
- Recurring debit orders
- Late window: EFT debits
- Early window debit orders: DebiCheck
- Early window debit orders: NAEDO

#### DebiCheck 
Leverage the most trusted way to authenticate and collect payments
Our DebiCheck portal enables you to initiate DebiCheck mandates directly in the BankTech console as part of your workflow.
DebiCheck collections process in the earliest window, before NAEDO and EFT, so they offer the highest collection success rate. To top it off, an authenticated mandate is not disputable, so payment persistency is improved significantly.
In short, our DebiCheck portal can help your business thrive with better cash flow.

#### Verification

Avoid losing business through failed transactions at the point of sale with our real-time Account Verification Service (AVSR). Check bank account information fast and cost-effectively, before collecting payments.

Add the AVSR functionality to your app workflow or batch verify to streamline your process.
Verify your customers in real-time with
- Bank account verification
- DebiCheck authentication
- Deceased status check
